= 11 * 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 
  6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1
= 39,916,800
A for loop had to be done at the end of 
each permutation (or during it) to loop 
through the entire permutation to determine 
the sum needed to be looked at in order to 
give the desired output (the least sum for among 
all the permutations).
