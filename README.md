# C_Programming_projects
 A collection of random extracurricular C programming projects.
These are only the readable C files. In order to run them, you will need to use a compiler, such as gcc (GNU Compiler Collection). These projects should all work with 
the GNU standard 11 version of gcc (if compiling in Linux, run with the flag "std=gnu11", no quotations, after "gcc", also no quotations).
