In hindsight, the program has a few problems.
The most notable one I found was that I never closed the file pointer "fp" in the "read_data(struct stock array[])" function, 
which I really should have done. 
Other than that, the main issues seem to be firstly, whitespace and secondly, compatibility with large datasets. Bubble sort is slow in comparison to merge sort for  
large datasets, although at the time I did not know about recursion since it wasn't taught in COP 3223H "Intro to C," it was taught in COP 3502C, "Computer  
Science 1." Moreover, the stock array was large enough for demonstration purposes, but far from large enough for an actual stocks dataset, which could contain thousands  
of stocks and other securities (such as warrants and bonds).
I also didn't have to use ASCII numbers to denote characters like 'y' or 'n,' I could have simply put the characters 'y' or 'n' within single quotation marks as I just 
did.
